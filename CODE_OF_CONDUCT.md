# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We, as members, contributors, and leaders, pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that foster an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of positive behavior that support a healthy community include:

* Showing empathy and kindness toward others  
* Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences  
* Giving and gracefully receiving constructive feedback  
* Taking responsibility and apologizing for mistakes, and learning from them  
* Prioritizing the community's well-being alongside individual interests  

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* Sexualized language, imagery, or attention of any kind  
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks  
* Harassment, whether public or private  
* Sharing others' private information without explicit permission  
* Any conduct that is inappropriate in a professional setting  

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards. They will take fair and appropriate corrective action in response to behavior deemed inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Leaders may remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, or other contributions that violate this Code of Conduct, and will provide explanations for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces and whenever an individual represents the community publicly. Representation includes using official emails, posting via official social media accounts, or acting as a community-appointed representative at online or offline events.

## Reporting & Enforcement

Incidents of abusive, harassing, or unacceptable behavior can be reported to community leaders. All reports will be reviewed promptly, fairly, and confidentially.

Community leaders are expected to respect the privacy and security of anyone reporting incidents.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** when determining consequences for violations:

### 1. Correction

**Impact**: Minor unprofessional or unwelcome behavior.  
**Consequence**: A private written warning explaining the violation and why the behavior is inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Impact**: A single incident or series of minor violations.  
**Consequence**: A warning with specific consequences for continued behavior. Temporary restrictions on interaction with involved parties may be applied. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Impact**: Serious or repeated violations, including sustained inappropriate behavior.  
**Consequence**: Temporary ban from community interactions for a specified period. No interaction with involved parties, including enforcement leaders, is allowed during this period. Violations may lead to a permanent ban.
